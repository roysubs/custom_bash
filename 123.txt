Learning terminal multiplexers makes Linux easier to work with. byobu is a suite of enhancements for tmux (on which it is built) with convenient shortcuts. Note that byobu will connect to already open sessions by default (tmux just opens a new session by default). - alias b='byobu' then 'b' to start, 'man byobu', F12-: then 'list-commands' to see all byobu console (F12-:) commands byobu-<tab><tab> to see all bash commands, can 'man' on each of these Shift-F1 (quick help, 'q' to exit), F1 (help/configuration UI, ESC to exit), F9 (byobu-config, but is same as F1) Alt-F12 (toggle mouse support on/off), or F12-: then 'set mouse on' / 'set mouse off' With mouse, click on panes and windows to switch. Scroll on panes with the mouse wheel or trackpad. Resize panes by dragging from edges Mouse support *breaks* copy/paste, but just hold down 'Shift' while selecting text and it works fine. Byobu shortcuts can interfere with other applications, - PANES: Ctrl-F2 (vertical split F12-%), Shift-F2 (horizontal split, F12-|) ('|' feels like it should be for 'vertical', so this is a little confusing) Shift-F3/F4 (jump between panes), Ctrl-F3/F4 (move a pane to a different location) Shift-<CursorKeys> (move between panes), Shift-Alt-<CursorKeys> (resize a pane), Shift-F8 (toggle pane arrangements) Shift-F8 (toggle panes through the grid templates), F12-z (toggle fullscreen/restore for a pane) Alt-PgUp (scroll up in current pane/window), Alt-PgDn (scroll down in current pane/window) Shift-F9 (enter command to run in all visible panes) Ctrl-F6 or Ctrl-D (kill the current pane that is in focus), or 'exit' in that pane Note: if the pane dividers disappear, press F5 to refresh status, including rebuilding the pane dividers. - WINDOWS: F2 (new window in current session) Alt-Left/Right or F3/F4 (toggle through windows), Ctrl-Shift-F3/F4 (move a window left or right) Ctrl-F6 or Ctrl-D (kill the current pane, more_apps.sh will kill the current window if there is only one pane), or 'exit' in that window - SESSIONS: Ctrl-Shift-F2 (new session i.e. a new tmux instance with only '0:-*'), Alt-Up/Down (toggle through sessions) F12-S (toggle through sessions with preview) F9: Enter command and run in all sessions F6 (detach the current session, leaving session running in background, and logout of byobu/tmux) Shift-F6 (detach the current, leaving session running in background, but do not logout of byobu/tmux) - F5 (reload profile, refresh status), Shift-F5 (toggle different status lines), Ctrl-Shift-F5 randomises status bar colours, to reset, use: rm ~/.byobu/color.tmux Alt-F5 (toggle UTF-8 support, refresh), Ctrl-F5 (reconnect ssh/gpg/dbus sockets) - F6 (detach session and logout), Shift-F6 (detach session and do not logout) Alt-F6 (detach ALL clients but this one), Ctrl-F6 (kill pane that is in focus) - F7 (enter scrollback history), Alt-PgUp/PgDn (enter and move through scrollback), Shift-F7 (save history to '$BYOBU_RUN_DIR/printscreen') - F8 (rename window), Ctrl-F8 (rename session), Shift-F8 (toggle panes through the grid templates) - F12-: (to enable the internal terminal), then 'set mouse on', then ENTER to enable mouse mode. For other commands, 'list-commands' F12-T (fullscreen graphical clock) To completely kill your session, and byobu in the background, type F12-: then 'kill-server' - 'b ls', 'b list-session' or 'b list-sessions' On starting byobu, session tray shows: u 20.04 0:-* 11d12h 0.00 4x3.4GHz 12.4G3%% 251G2%% 2021-04-27 08:41:50 u = Ubuntu, 20.04 = version, 0:~* is the session, 11d12h = uptime, 0.00 = ?, 4x3.40GHz = 3.4GHz Core i5 with 4 cores 12.4G3%% = 12.4 G free memory, 3%% CPU usage, 251G2%% = 251 G free space, 2%% used, 2021-04-27 08:41:50 = date/time - byobu-<tab><tab> to see all byobu bash commands, can 'man <command>' on each of these byobu-config byobu-enable-prompt byobu-launcher byobu-quiet byobu-select-session byobu-tmux byobu-ctrl-a byobu-export byobu-launcher-install byobu-reconnect-sockets byobu-shell byobu-ugraph byobu-disable byobu-janitor byobu-launcher-uninstall byobu-screen byobu-silent byobu-ulevel byobu-disable-prompt byobu-keybindings byobu-layout byobu-select-backend byobu-status byobu-enable byobu-launch byobu-prompt byobu-select-profile byobu-status-detail byobu cheat sheet / keybindings: https://cheatography.com/mikemikk/cheat-sheets/byobu-keybindings/ byobu good tutorial: https://simonfredsted.com/1588 https://gist.github.com/jshaw/5255721 Learn byobu (enhancement for tmux) while listening to Mozart: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NawuGmcvKus Learn tmux (all commands work in byobu also): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHhA_ZKjyxo Tutorial Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0upAE692fY Tutorial Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sD5zlW8a5E , His .dotfiles: https://github.com/agilesteel/.dotfiles , https://www.youtube.com/c/DevInsideYou/playlists Byobu: https://byobu.org/​ , tmux: https://tmux.github.io/​ , Screen: https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/​
