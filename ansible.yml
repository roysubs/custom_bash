# Ansible – add user to sudo2019-09-27 by Wojciech Błaszkowski
# I’m using Ansible for some time. Great tool! Now for some example; allow user to use sudo.

# Many tasks samples look’s like this (tabs/spaces cut by dummy WP editor! sorry!):

- name: Ensuring that wheel is able to use sudo without password
    lineinfile:
    path: /etc/sudoers
    regexp: '^%wheel'
    line: '%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL'
    validate: 'visudo -cf %s'

If it it’s not, they hack the /etc/sudoers file. Then they add a shell user as a member of wheel group:

- name: Setup Ansible User
    user:
    name: ansible
    comment: Ansible Management User
    group: wheel

# But we wish that new user had’s only it’s own group. Or they add a shell user to the main /etc/sudoers file:

- name: Add user to sudoers file
    lineinfile:
    path: /etc/sudoers
    regexp: '^ansibleuser'
    line: 'ansibleuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL'
    validate: 'visudo -cf %s'

# It is true, that the lineinfile module’s validate option will NOT write any changes to the path file if the result of validation command will not be positive. But why to hack the /etc/sudoers every time?

# I prefer to create single file for each user, like so:

- name: Add user "ansibleuser" to sudo
    lineinfile:
    path: /etc/sudoers.d/ansibleuser
    line: 'ansibleuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL'
    state: present
    mode: 0440
create: yes
validate: 'visudo -cf %s'

# That’s all. We can make sure, that the includedir in sudoers is in /etc/sudoers file (this is one time hack if not present):

- name: Set includedir in sudoers
lineinfile:
dest: /etc/sudoers
line: "includedir /etc/sudoers.d"
state: present
validate: "/usr/sbin/visudo -cf %s"

# That is easy to manage; both by hand and via automation tools like Ansible. Feel free to comment! :)
